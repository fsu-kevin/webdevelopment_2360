                <h1><em>Overview</em></h1>
                <p>Solar energy is energy captured from the sun that is used to make electricity for us to use in our homes. Solar energy is the most abundant energy source that we can utilize on earth , it is also the cleanest for us to use.</p>
                <br>
                
                <p>Using solar energy produces many great outcomes for the environment as well for as the user. Since the suns energy is unlimited, we can harness it's energy to power our cars, home, and anyhting else that uses electricity. </p>

                <h3><em>Solar Panels</em></h3>
                <p>Solar panels are panels made up of many solar cells that form an electrical current when photons hit the cell. This form of energy can save you thousands over the course of the time you spend in your residence. Electricity companies will even pay you if your solar panels generate more electricity than you use, and this could be a great source of cheap reliable energy. </p>
                
                <p>When talking about solar energy, it is also important to note that it has some pitfalls. Since solar energy cannot be collected at night so you'd have to use a battery pack to collect energy that can be used at night. Also, cloudy weather can make the technology unreliable at times. Even with these drawbacks, solar energy is still a great investment and although installation can be expensive, solar panels usually pay for themselves within 5-10 years after installation. Talk about a good deal! </p>
